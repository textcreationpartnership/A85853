         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I am juſtly tender of exaſperating ſo vehement and unfeigned a grief as your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> hath conſtantly expreſſed to the noble M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Rich</hi> (both living and languiſhing, dying and dead) by my applying any ſuch <hi>Balſame</hi> as may ſeem to renew your wound and pain; yet knowing that your <hi>Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> greateſt comforts (next thoſe of divine infuſion) ariſe from thoſe proportions which your juſt ſorrows bear to your generous affections, which are now become the occaſion and meaſure of your affliction, I thought it would neither be offenſive to your <hi>honour,</hi> nor unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming my reſpects, if I juſtified your exceeding grief, by repreſenting to the world how diſervedly you have <hi>loved,</hi> and how worthily you have <hi>mourned,</hi> for that Gentleman, of whoſe honour and happineſs (even from his infancy) I was moſt ſeriouſly ambitious.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that I have adventured to dedicate to your <hi>Name</hi> this <hi>Funeral Cordial,</hi> which was firſt devoted to adorn the Chriſtian Interment, and revive the honored Name of your dear <hi>Huſband;</hi> that ſince <hi>You</hi> lived not long together in your marriage, yet <hi>You</hi> might, at leaſt, be inſeparable in this <hi>monument:</hi> which aims not to add any further ſecular pomp to his duſt, much leſs to gratifie the impertinent curioſity of
<pb facs="tcp:114785:3"/>this or after ages, touching his life, ſickneſs, diſeaſe, or death, but rather to advance the glory of God in his unſearchable ways; alſo to ſummon ſuch as yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him to <hi>conſider</hi> their <hi>latter ends,</hi> that they may betimes, even <hi>in youth remember their Creator,</hi> and apply their hearts to true ſaving and <hi>eternal wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe great and good ends I preſume your <hi>Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> paſſionate piety will permit me to improve ſo ſad a diſpenſation of <hi>providence,</hi> whoſe aſpect not only looks to your <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> but to all that ſtand within the view, reach and terror of ſo ſharp a ſtroak, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be ſo far <hi>laid to heart</hi> by all ſpectators, until they find their hearts mollified and mended through that gracious virtue, which may by fear of <hi>death</hi> and grief for <hi>ſin</hi> make way for faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and love of <hi>God.</hi> Certainly a <hi>penitent</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> uſe is the beſt that can be made of ſuch dreadful monitions; that no ſeeming ſplendor of proſperity, no vain confidences of youth and life, no cumulations of worldly contents, no momentary honours and imaginary pleaſures ſhould either blind or divert any of us from dayly taking a ſerious proſpect of our ſins and our ſouls, of our death and judgement, of our God and Saviour: Nothing in all my lifes obſervation (except one unparallel'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) hath ever faln out of more pregnant and potent influence, to abate the preſumption of human vanity, worldly confidence, and earthly glory, than the ſudden <hi>Eclipſe</hi> and fall of this great <hi>Star,</hi> which was but lately riſen to its luſtre and conſpicuity. The contemplation of his ſo early death is no ſmall warning to us, that are yet living, eſpecially to thoſe, who moſt dally with death, while they affect a <hi>dilatory indifferency</hi> as to any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of repentance and true piety; being afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as of being <hi>good</hi> too ſoon, as if they
<pb facs="tcp:114785:3"/>could be too ſoon in a capacity of happineſs.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>madneſs</hi> of many, who have had not only ingenuous but religious breeding, is uſually ſuch, that though they pleaſe themſelves in being civil and accompliſt toward men, yet they make no ſcruple of being neglective, rude, affrontive, yea <hi>inſolent</hi> toward God, and therein <hi>cruel to their own ſouls,</hi> forgetting (at once) both their moment and God's <hi>eternity:</hi> which deſperate frolick uſually holds with many, not only during the adventerous extravagancies of their youth and ſpring (which is the chief hour of temptation and power of darkneſs) but it extends by the <hi>hardning habits</hi> and deceitfulneſs of our ſinful <hi>hearts</hi> to our <hi>Autumn</hi> and decline; God knows our vicious <hi>acceſſes</hi> to the vanities, and inordinacies of life are early and ſpeedy; but our gracious <hi>receſſes</hi> in order to an holy life and happy death are very flow and late if ever, unleſs ſpecial grace prevent the beſt of nature, and God's good Spirit perfect the beſt of our educations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madame,</hi> I write not at this rate, out of a <hi>Cenſorian</hi> vanity to reproach others; but out of an humble ſenſe of my own infirmities; and out of a Chriſtian ſympathy to others impendent miſeries. Alas 'tis too evident that many perſons (otherways of excellent &amp; uſeful parts) do live amidſt the <hi>offers of eternal life,</hi> and the <hi>terrors</hi> of <hi>eternal death,</hi> as if they had never laid to heart, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their own or any others <hi>death;</hi> no nor the death of their <hi>bleſſed Saviour;</hi> by the price of whoſe blood they have been both <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> redeemed from <hi>their vain converſation;</hi> It is both a ſad and ſhameful thing to conſider, that the leaſt and laſt thoughts of many <hi>(titularly Chriſtians)</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to their God, their Saviour and their Souls. Theſe grand concernments are late, unwelcome, and but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:114785:4"/>admitted after the <hi>ſurfeits</hi> of ſenſual pleaſures, the crowds and peſter of worldly affairs, the importunities of ambitious deſigns, and other buſie vanities, which ſo ingroſs the whole man and time, that there is little place allowed in moſt mens and womens hearts, or ſpace in their lives (which are always upon the confines and brink of <hi>death</hi>) for that great point of wiſedom and work of ſalvation, which conſiſts in beginning betimes to reſiſt and retrench thoſe evils to which our depraved hearts do naturally prompt us; that ſo we might with greater ſpeed and leſs impediment advance to that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi> and <hi>immutable good</hi> to which as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and <hi>beſeeched</hi> by the tender mercies and love of God in Chriſt, ſo by the principles of true reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and no leſs by the real intereſts of our own <hi>ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, honour,</hi> and eternal felicity.</p>
            <p>The promoting of all which being my main deſign in publiſhing this grave <hi>piece,</hi> I hope both your Ladiſhips great ſadneſs and paſſion, and my own deep <hi>reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for the dead, may be ſufficient <hi>Apology</hi> for my freedom both of tongue and pen toward the <hi>living:</hi> not only my natural <hi>genius</hi> prompting me, but my <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> commanding me (ſpecially in publique and ſacred <hi>remonſtrances</hi>) to <hi>ſpeak</hi> and <hi>write out,</hi> that is, to uſe ſuch honeſt <hi>Parrheſie</hi> as will leaſt ſmother wholeſome <hi>truths</hi> or flatter ſecure <hi>ſins.</hi> Nothing is more deformed then <hi>paraſitick preachers,</hi> or <hi>mealy-mouthed Miniſters:</hi> He that ſpeaketh or writeth (which is a ſilent preaching, a ſpeech without noiſe, or words without a voice) in <hi>Chriſts name</hi> and authority to ſinful and ſecure mortals had need be in very good earneſt, fervent in ſpirit, unflattering in ſpeech, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſerious, yea kindly ſevere, with all <hi>meekneſs</hi> of <hi>wiſedom.</hi> For Preachers of the Goſpel are ordained of
<pb facs="tcp:114785:4"/>God to be <hi>Antiparaſites,</hi> purpoſely to croſſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter that pleaſing but pernitious humor in mankind, which loves to deceive and flatter, even to the death, both themſelves and others: the itching ſores which others love to ſcratch, we muſt <hi>wound</hi> that we may <hi>heal</hi> them; and if ever we (the ſo deſpiſed Miniſters of Chriſt) dare to own our ſelves in our <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>commiſſion</hi> (which is divine, or none) it ſhould be at <hi>Funerals,</hi> when ſtandinng, as it were, upon the <hi>Tombs</hi> and urns of the dead, we have more then ordinarily the higher ground above the the <hi>living;</hi> all whoſe pleaſures, profits, pride, power, and pomp ſhould be then like the <hi>Moon</hi> under our feet, when (as Gods <hi>Heraulds,</hi> or leſſer <hi>Angels</hi>) we ſummon all that hear or read us to <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgement:</hi> the due and timely prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for which is the great leſſon <hi>Miniſters</hi> have to preach and people to practiſe. For which purpoſe I have uſed ſuch pathetick freedom of expreſſing my ſelf, as may (by Gods bleſſing) be uſeful and ſo acceptable to many, but juſtly <hi>offenſive</hi> to none, that either are truly wiſe or would be good and happy in Gods way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which is grace and holineſs.</p>
            <p>The enſuing diſcourſe is now (as your Honour eaſily perceives) much inlarged beyond the <hi>Horary</hi> limits of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> exceeding in length woſi of the ancient Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I wiſh it might equal them in uſefulneſs, weight and worth. For in recollecting and ruminating my meditations, they eaſily multiplied, and in tranſcribing my <hi>notes</hi> as I had prepared them, I added with <hi>Baruch (Jer. 36.32.) many like words</hi> to what I had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and had penned, but omitted, being neceſſarily and ſo excuſably contracted in the Pulpit, but now more dilated in the <hi>Preſs,</hi> according to my own deſign and
<pb facs="tcp:114785:5"/>the deſire of others, who have a great <hi>empire</hi> over me; What then was in my preaching more <hi>maſſive</hi> and <hi>rough hewen</hi> than I intended, I have now <hi>malleated</hi> and <hi>poliſhed,</hi> not only to an ampler, but I hope to a more auguſt proportion. That it may be ſomewhat anſwerable to thoſe great reſpects of love and honour which I have not only to this <hi>noble Gentleman,</hi> but to his <hi>honorable Relations,</hi> and particularly to his moſt <hi>virtuous Mother;</hi> The few years of whoſe mortal life, as he oft foretold (in my hearing) he ſhould not exceed, ſo he did not attain to equal them; God verifying his <hi>preſages</hi> by his <hi>immature death;</hi> being ſo far diſtant from his <hi>excellent Mother</hi> that ſhe might be ſaid to die in her <hi>April,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> (her only child) in the <hi>February of his age,</hi> as many years ſooner as a month hath weeks. Due regard to both their memories, alſo to <hi>Your Ladiſhips honour,</hi> who had neereſt relation to <hi>him,</hi> and ſo greateſt affection for him. Theſe, next my higheſt and more religious deſigns, may I hope, not only excuſe the gravity and prolixity of this Epiſtle to ſo young a Lady, but alſo patroniſe my thus publiſhing my ſelf <hi>(Madame)</hi>

               <hi>Grace</hi> is ſo far from <hi>ſtupifying</hi> or <hi>petrifying</hi> mens hearts, that it takes away the <hi>heart of ſin,</hi> and gives <hi>a heart of fleſh;</hi> it ſoftens us not only to God and our ſelves, but to others alſo: nothing is further from a true and <hi>genuine Chriſtian</hi> then either putid <hi>affectation,</hi> or ſtupid <hi>in affectedneſs,</hi> I mean that ſurly <hi>apathy,</hi> and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>indolency</hi> of ſoul, which argues a ſpirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience rather <hi>ſcorched</hi> and <hi>ſeared</hi> in the furnace of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>luſts</hi> and particular <hi>factions,</hi> than <hi>ſteeped</hi> in the <hi>blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, or <hi>ſuppled</hi> with the gentle oyl of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian charity,</hi> which is the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of every true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>We have this <hi>receipt</hi> how to make a right uſe of the <hi>Dead</hi> from <hi>Solomons</hi> great <hi>experience</hi> and exact obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things; whoſe accurate <hi>palate</hi> was not glutted or confounded, nor the <hi>edge</hi> of his taſte blunted or dulled by the <hi>luxurious guſto,</hi> the delicacy, plenty, and variety
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114785:7"/>of all things to which he <hi>applied</hi> his <hi>heart,</hi> whoſe <hi>wiſedom remained with him;</hi> That wiſedome which God gave him upon his <hi>wiſe choiſe</hi> of <hi>wiſedom</hi> rather then of <hi>riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 1.10.</note> revenge, long life,</hi> or <hi>pleaſure.</hi> The deſire of <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> is the ſureſt way to obtain it; for the ſoule by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſires (like <hi>a chrystal glaſs</hi>) is poliſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, that it eaſily receives the <hi>beams</hi> of wiſedome into its ſelf, which (like the Sun) ſhine equally upon all <hi>men,</hi> and are alike receptible by all; where the groſs and <hi>opacous</hi> temper, the <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>earthly luſts,</hi> the dull and dirty <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of mens ſoules being wiped off, or purged and refined, there is no inward impediment or cloud to hinder.</p>
            <p>This is one great Inſtance that <hi>Solomons</hi> wives, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of concubines, with his other proportionable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage and proviſions of ſenſual pleaſures, had not <hi>exhauſted</hi> his wiſedome, in that he now, as a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Preacher,</hi> makes this wiſe choiſe, <hi>That it is better to goe to the houſe of mourning then to the houſe of feaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Better in many and great reſpects; chiefly for this, that it ſadly and ſolemnly ſets forth to us <hi>the end of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A conſideration worthy of the living, who are infinitely concerned in the ſame fate and ſtate attending them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And which they may then turn to a good account, when they ſeriouſly lay the matter and manner, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and ſolemnity of <hi>Funerals</hi> to <hi>their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Which they will doe, if they are truly <hi>living,</hi> in a rational, prudent, and religious way of life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For then they muſt needs be very ſenſible what need their <hi>hearts</hi> have of ſuch <hi>applications;</hi> even of <hi>death,</hi> and the <hi>houſe of mourning to them.</hi> And what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages a <hi>wiſe</hi> man (one that hath an humble, holy, and gracious heart) may gain by ſuch <hi>warnings</hi> and <hi>alarms,</hi> which in many regards are proper to be <hi>laid to heart by all</hi> thoſe that are truly living to God and his grace; yea even ſuch as are yet only <hi>living</hi> as <hi>beaſts</hi> to their ſenſes,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114785:7"/>and as men to civil <hi>converſation,</hi> being dead to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; <hi>life of God,</hi> theſe may hence learn to <hi>know God</hi> and <hi>themſelves;</hi> yea they may be excited and enabled to live to <hi>his glory,</hi> and to <hi>work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This choiſe and receipt of <hi>Solomon</hi> is conſiderable in general, as to its chief ingredient, <hi>the houſe of mourning,</hi> or the condition <hi>of the dead;</hi> which 2. will be beſt ſet forth, if we conſider <hi>the perſons</hi> to whom he applies it, the <hi>living,</hi> whoſe duty and wiſdome it is not to deſpiſe thoſe <hi>ſpectacles</hi> and inſtances of mortality. 3.

            </p>
            <p>When I have given you this account of <hi>the Text,</hi> in order to the religious <hi>benefit of the living,</hi> I ſhall anſwer your wonted curioſity and expectation, in <hi>giving</hi> you ſome <hi>account</hi> alſo of the <hi>Dead,</hi> upon whoſe occaſion we are now met; that I may at once doe <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſo much right as truth and juſtice firſt, next my love and honour to <hi>him,</hi> together with my <hi>charity</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> command me to doe; apart from all ſiniſter <hi>fears</hi> or <hi>flatteries,</hi> without any partiality, or oblique paſſion, toward the <hi>living,</hi> or the <hi>dead:</hi> which depraved diſtempers can at no time become me, or any Miniſter of Chriſt, and leaſt of all now, when I have ſet <hi>before me,</hi> and am to ſet forth to you, ſuch a ſad and ſerious proſpect <hi>of the dead,</hi> as ought to <hi>mortifie</hi> all our <hi>impotent paſſions</hi> and inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>My firſt endeavour muſt be to ſet forth to you in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral this <hi>part of Solomons wiſedome,</hi> which we may call a kind of <hi>ſacred Necromancie,</hi> or <hi>Necromathy,</hi> by which he had learned himſelf, and inſtructs others, to make an holy <hi>uſe of the Dead;</hi> rather to goe to <hi>the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the blackeſt attire and repreſentations of it (which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114785:8"/>are at <hi>Funerals</hi>) then to goe to the houſe <hi>of feaſting,</hi> or to frequent thoſe <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> either civil or ſacred, which invited poor mortals to more mirth and jollity of ſpirit, but to leſs of <hi>mortifiedneſs</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> then their <hi>ſinful, frail, and dangerous condition</hi> did require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> (no doubt) had obſerved that <hi>Feaſts,</hi> like full diet to <hi>foul bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Morbum non hominem alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Morbi fomitem ſubducentes.</note> did but pamper their <hi>diſeaſes;</hi> but <hi>Funerals,</hi> like Phyſick that is leſs palatable yet more wholſome, did help to purge <hi>the body,</hi> to lighten nature. <hi>Feaſts,</hi> like fair weather, or Summer, are prone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get many <hi>vermine,</hi> many putid and peſtilent <hi>ſavours,</hi> both in our minds and bodies; but <hi>Funerals,</hi> like <hi>froſty weather,</hi> give check to the luxuriancy of evil humours, of evil weeds, and offenſive ſavours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holy Job</hi> was jealous of the dangerous effects accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of his <hi>children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1.5.</note> however brought up both by his precept and example to all <hi>pious</hi> and juſt <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities:</hi> He was afraid with a godly and paternal fear, leſt they had <hi>curſed God in their hearts;</hi> that is, <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> or <hi>privatively,</hi> not bleſſing him at all, or not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the <hi>bounty</hi> they enjoyed, leſt, partaking of his gifts, they might forget the <hi>Giver,</hi> and love, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or admire the <hi>creature</hi> more then the <hi>Creator.</hi> For no experience is more frequent then to ſee <hi>ſurfeiting bodies</hi> to be as the <hi>ſepulchres</hi> of <hi>famiſhed ſoules;</hi> to ſee <hi>plenty</hi> digeſted into <hi>impiety,</hi> as ſweet and fat things turn to choler; from principles of love and civility, men ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to treat their friends with plenty,
<note place="margin">Lenocinumi gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</note> variety, delicacy of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks.</hi> This, by the <hi>inchantment</hi> of the taſte, tempts to ſuperfluity and exceſs, beyond the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of holy mirth and <hi>ſober ſatiety,</hi> which God doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny, nor envy us; once beyond the banks of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> the wine and ſtrong drink boyl up mens ſpirits to <hi>madneſs,</hi> to begin and enforce ſo many unhealthful <hi>healths</hi> by a deviliſh kind of importunity and helliſh ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, till <hi>ſurfeiting</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> till all manner of <hi>petulancy</hi> and violence, like a deluge or ſpring-tide, overwhelm all that is <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>religious,</hi> civil or humane
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114785:8"/>in them; till their <hi>bodies</hi> are become the ſinks of all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; till ſhameful <hi>ſpewing,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, is upon their tables, beds, and boſoms; till their <hi>comedies of feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> end in <hi>tragedies of fighting,</hi> if not with their friends, yet with their God and their <hi>own ſoules;</hi> and this in ſo ingrate and indigne a manner, as is moſt <hi>impudent:</hi> for, armed with the weapons of <hi>Gods bounty,</hi> power, and wiſedome, they fly in his face, and fight againſt his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> contrary to the gentleneſs and gratitude of beaſts, which doe not readily return any rude or offenſive acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to thoſe that are their feeders; ſo that the unholy and unthankful carriage of men in their exceſſes againſt God, is not far from <hi>curſing of him;</hi> yea many times men run out to ſuch <hi>riot</hi> at <hi>Feaſts,</hi> as to number their oathes by their glaſſes and diſhes; every bit, and every draught muſt be <hi>ſawced</hi> with the <hi>haugouſt</hi> of ſwearing, of profane and Atheiſtical <hi>rallieries</hi> againſt God and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

It muſt needs be an hudling and moſt confuſed work then to ſet thy <hi>houſe in order,</hi> I mean that <hi>(interiorem animae domum)</hi> inward withdrawing room of thy ſoul, thy <hi>heart,</hi> (which ought to be as a Temple always fitted for God, purged from ſin, adorned with all <hi>gracious habits</hi>) then when the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> or <hi>out-houſe of thy body,</hi> in which thy ſoul dwels, is wholly out of order, either <hi>burning</hi> with feavoriſh flames, or <hi>tottering</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionary weakneſs, or burdened and falling with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural loads and painful obſtructions. Thou couldſt never have choſen a worſe or unfitter time to <hi>repent,</hi> then when the pains of ſickneſs, the inquietudes of body, the impertinent viſits of friends, the cryes of relations, the want of ſleep, all extremities, the terrors of death, and the <hi>ſtupors</hi> of ſoul are before thee, or preſſing upon thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is a work to be begun ſeriouſly, in the moſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114785:29"/>ſedate temper of ſoul, and <hi>calmeſt</hi> ſtate of life; when we enjoy the greateſt ſerenity of body and mind; when we have moſt leiſure, feweſt interruptions, and leaſt diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſtrongeſt temptations, potenteſt oppoſitions, and the greateſt abilities of ſoul to reſiſt them. Once well begun, it muſt at the ſame rate be <hi>carried</hi> on every day: For this, like oft pumping in a ſhip that hath but little leaks, will keep her afloat; but it is deſperate plying the pump when a veſſel hath now ſo many foot water in hold that it begins to ſink. The early repentings in our health are the beſt <hi>Antidotes</hi> and <hi>Cordials</hi> in our ſickneſs, like Summer proviſions ſeaſonably laid in againſt an hard Winter; nor is there any bitter potion which a ſick man is leſs able or <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to take then that of <hi>Repentance,</hi> when he is weak, languiſhing, ſunk, diſpirited, almoſt deſpairing in his ſickneſs; which is like a mans ſetting himſelf to cleave logs, and therewith to make himſelf a fire, when he is ſo benummed and feeble with cold that he can hardly lift his hands to his head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, no man hath much cauſe to preſume his <hi>repentance</hi> will be accepted of God when it comes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force at the dregs and fag end of his life. Laſtly, a man can then leaſt reliſh and reflect upon ſuch late and neceſſitated repentance, as to the comfort and joy of his own ſoul: for the beſt trial and taſte of true repentance is to be had in health, amidſt the exerciſes and aſſaults of temptations; then if it hold ſound and firm, it argues it to be of proof and ſafe.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is nothing in our life ſo neceſſary to be done, and ſo worthy of our living, as our timely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting;</hi> for if life were for nothing elſe but an enflaming the reckonings of our ſins here, and our miſeries hereafter, it were a thouſand times better never to be born, or to ſee the Sun. The great <hi>end</hi> of our life is firſt to remove the <hi>ſordes</hi> and rubbidg of our ſins, next to build up our <hi>ſouls</hi> for God by grace to glory; which two make up the compleat work of repentance, which like <hi>currant coin</hi> hath two ſides ſtampt, or impreſſions on it, the one is as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114785:30"/>croſs, the other is as pile; the firſt is as turning from ſin, or <hi>dying</hi> to ſin; the other is turning to God, and <hi>living</hi> to grace. Theſe are wrought by a double ſtamp upon the ſoul: 1. Of fear and terrour, ſcaring us from ſin by the juſt apprehenſions of the anger and wrath of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, and in the heart. 2. Of love and mercy, winning us to God by the beauty <hi>of holineſs,</hi> and the brightneſs of his goodneſs, which appears in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, ſet forth in the Evangelical promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>breaks,</hi> the ſecond <hi>melts</hi> the heart: The one is commonly much hidden, where the other moſt <hi>appears</hi> to the ſoule, either in fear or love; which have their wholſome viciſſitudes, till the work be perfected by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to amendment, by hatred of ſin from the love of God. This ſeaſonably, leiſurely and ſeriouſly done, doth ſtrangely advance the ſouls faith, comfort, and hope of Gods love in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But it is neither an <hi>eaſie nor a ready thing</hi> to diſcerne the bright <hi>jewel</hi> of aſſurance, as Gods love, mercy, and pardon, there where the ſoul is all in <hi>duſt,</hi> and hurry, and confuſion, moving and removing its lumber and rubbiſh. A troubled <hi>water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.20.</note> though it be pure, will not ſhew a clear reflexion of our own or anothers face; no more will a troubled ſpirit, eſpecially if it be foul with mire and dirt, as a wicked heart is; though a late repentant, may find favour in Gods ſight, who can ſee our ſincerity amidſt all our confuſions; yet it is hard for us to have ſo clear a <hi>ſight of God,</hi> as may amount to that plerophory, ſtrong comfort and aſſurance, which a dying man, affected with his condition, would deſire even beyond life it ſelf, or a thouſand worlds; having now before his eyes the diſmal aſpect of death, the black Abyſſus of eternal night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds or bottome, made up of deſolation and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion at beſt, and (which is inſinitely more horrid) of <hi>damnation</hi> and <hi>eternal torments;</hi> a Tophet <hi>that burns with much wood, kindled by the breath of Gods diſpleaſure, which none can quench.</hi>

            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114785:30"/>
            <p>I know it is not fit to obſtruct or ſhrink the mercies of God, where there is yet any hope, poſſibility, or capacity allowed us by Gods indulgence. They found <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in a priſon, and the thief on <hi>the Croſſe,</hi> and the prodigal ſon at the <hi>ſwine-trough;</hi> by which ſharp <hi>pennances</hi> God brought them firſt to themſelves, then to himſelf by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſo accepted of them. I know <hi>God</hi> can, and I believe ſometimes he doth ſanctifie ſickneſs to the like good effects: But we have no one example of <hi>death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed repentance</hi> ſo much as once recorded in Scripture, to give any inſtance of hope in that kind, or to occaſion the leaſt <hi>preſumption</hi> impenitently to ſin away our health, by putting off our turning to God, till <hi>the time</hi> that we can ſcarce <hi>turn our</hi> ſelves in our bed. <hi>Repentance</hi> like <hi>Poetry</hi> (for it is a new making of the ſoul for God, a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it to the holy meeters or meaſures of his Word) requires <hi>ſolitude</hi> and <hi>receſſes</hi> of mind,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.4.</note> that the heart of man may commune <hi>with it ſelf</hi> and <hi>be ſtill;</hi> ſeriouſly reflecting upon a mans ſelf, what he is; where he lives; whence he is ſprung; whither he tends; to what end he lives; what he would have to make him happy; whether this world can doe it; where he may beſt know, and how he may doe the will of his Maker and Preſerver, God; what he will doe in age, ſickneſs, death; what relation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and capacity above all things under heaven he hath as a reaſonable creature toward the Creator; from what wiſedom, power, and goodneſs all his viſible and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comforts flow; what duty and gratitude, what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and holineſs befits him to God and man; what to himſelf and his own future intereſts, both as to ſoul and body; which may without doubt be as capable of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-happineſs or miſery, which we call heaven and hell, in their aſpects to the ſupreme and increated good, as they are here of health or ſickneſs, poverty or riches, honour or diſgrace, joy or grief, vexation or pleaſure, a momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary heaven or hell in reference to thoſe creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts they enjoy or want.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114785:31"/>in ſeeing ſee Gods will, and apply himſelf to do his duty: But this muſt be done apart, and by himſelf, when there are leaſt diverſions, no diſtractions of body or mind; that removed from the noiſe and <hi>tintamars</hi> both of ſecular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, or <hi>ſick annoyances,</hi> he may better hear the <hi>gentle and orderly</hi> voice of God, who is oftner in theſe ſilent and ſoft motions of reaſon, then in thoſe louder <hi>earthquakes</hi> and <hi>terrours</hi> of <hi>afflictions.</hi> Nor can any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and prudent Divine, as the Confeſſor and Comforter of ſuch a <hi>troubled ſpirit,</hi> whoſe inward troubles for ſin never began, or were kindly entertained, till the <hi>unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come trouble</hi> of his ſickneſs made him a priſoner to his bed (as the preſage of his <hi>after-jayls,</hi> the grave and hell;) In ſuch caſes (I ſay) no wiſe and worthy <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt</hi> but will be very wary how by the keyes of the Goſpel he ſhut all diſquiet for ſin out of ſuch a ſoule, or let in the <hi>peace of God ſuddenly,</hi> as to any particular confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or <hi>perſonal aſſurance,</hi> which in ſuch caſes muſt needs be very dark.</p>

            <p>In which, at the beſt advance and proficiency of it, eſpecially in people of riper years and full age, who have filled up the <hi>meaſure of their iniquity,

Nothing of force and compulſion is ſo acceptable to others, or ſo reflecting with honour and comfort to a mans ſelf, as that which flowes from the freedome of love, and ſuch adherences as ariſe from choiſe and value. A <hi>forced Repentance</hi> begun on our ſick beds, (poſſibly) may, as <hi>muskmelons</hi> and other tender plants, which are bred in hot beds, come to good; but they muſt be very carefully and warily <hi>tended,</hi> for a little cold <hi>chills</hi> and kills them.

How vain is it to ſtep unſeaſonably into <hi>the water</hi> if the <hi>Angel</hi> move it not? there may be a royling of the pool by us, but no <hi>healing</hi> for us.

            <p>Let thy mourning be not only civil, formal, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but Chriſtian, humble, penitent:

If it be matter of civil ſtate and decorum to perſons of great quality, yet I ſee no ſenſe or reaſon they ſhould juſtle out of the Church any offices of Chriſtian piety befitting the dead or the living.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the Text, and am now to give you (Right Honorable and Beloved) ſome little model of this houſe of mourning to which you are come this day, which is greater in many degrees then you are wonted to go to. This ſad occaſion (if rightly underſtood) will make its <hi>own way to your hearts,</hi> when I have given you ſome account of thoſe <hi>ſpecial regards</hi> for which it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not only a more then ordinary mourning, empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſympathies from you, but to make deeper impreſſions upon your ſpirits. And this I ſhall do briefly, not <hi>(tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam conductitius orator, &amp; venalis praeco)</hi> or as a man <hi>(profeſſoriae linguae &amp; truncae manus,</hi> as <hi>Agrippina</hi> called <hi>Seneca)</hi> no, I thank God I am above any ſuch ſnares and ſervitudes of ſoul as will for fear or favour flatter either the dead or the living. What I ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>dead</hi> ſhall be words of <hi>ſoberneſs</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> as in the preſence of God and of you his people (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And however I am moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly ſorry, as a man, for this ſad occaſion, yet I am, as a Miniſter, ſo far glad of this preſent imployment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, however I may be leſs proportionable to its <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions</hi> and your <hi>expectations,</hi> yet I have (hereby) the opportunity given me to expreſs ſuch an honour, love, and reſpect to this <hi>noble perſon's</hi> name and memory now dead, as (I confeſs) was one of my <hi>higheſt ambitions</hi> in this world.</p>
            <p>Not only as he ſtood related a <hi>Grand-child, Son,</hi> and <hi>Heir apparent</hi> to that <hi>Right Honorable Family,</hi> whoſe

But taking him in his private <hi>ſphear</hi> and perſonal <hi>confinements,</hi> you will give me leave to own him as a <hi>Gentleman</hi> many ways endeared to my particular love, care, honour, and prayers; firſt by long acquaintance, from his <hi>cradle</hi> to his <hi>coffin,</hi> which breeds ſecret and tacit endearments on our hearts, as <hi>Ivy</hi> that roots where it is long <hi>contiguous;</hi> Next by neerer and <hi>domeſtick converſation,</hi> he <hi>living four years</hi> in my houſe, with his Tutor and other <hi>attendants</hi> befitting his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at thoſe years, when being but a youth of 13 or 14 years, he carried himſelf with ſo much <hi>civility, modeſty, ingenuity,</hi> and <hi>manlineſs,</hi> as made his company both worthy and fit for men; ſo <hi>little</hi> of petulancy, <hi>pride,</hi> or moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, incident to young Gentlemen of high parts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that he ſeemed by his gentleneſs, <hi>candor,</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> as if he were ignorant both of his own high and noble quality, and alſo of others uſual but ignoble <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>vapourings,</hi> which ill become any men, but moſt of all thoſe that pretend to any true honour or generous extraction.</p>
            <p>The confidence of his <hi>noble parents</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him thus to my care and <hi>ſuperintendency,</hi> gave me an opportunity as welcome to me as any could have befaln me, which was to diſcharge a ſolemn promiſe I made to his moſt <hi>noble Mother</hi> ſeven years before, not only with <hi>civility,</hi> but with <hi>ſanctity,</hi> at her earneſt and importune deſiring of me to aſſure her, while I lived, I would not be wanting, what in me lay, to his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>happineſs;</hi> She alſo then beſpake his living with me, when ever it ſhould be opportune for his <hi>breeding,</hi> and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of him.</p>

            <p>But my attending the ſetledneſs of his ſtation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life (as moſt proper for ſuch a preſent) cauſed my deferring ſo long the publiſhing of it, even untill the <hi>fatal cloſing</hi> of his eyes (for whoſe ſight it was chiefly deſigned) hath now condemned it to correſpond with that <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> to which he is gone as to this world.</p>
            <p>I now appeal to all <hi>Hearers</hi> and <hi>Readers</hi> (of any Nobleneſs and ingenuity) whether I am not excuſable if I do with more then ordinary reſentments of ſorrow <hi>lay to heart</hi> the death of this young Nobleman, to whom I was ſo truly devoted and juſtly indeared. After that rate of care and kindneſs which the bleſſed St. <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo far to a young man of great hopes (as the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtories tell us) that when the <hi>good old man</hi> heard his <hi>dear depoſitum</hi> had deſerted his breeding,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Euſeb. Hiſto. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> and endangered his ſoul, he not only ſeverely reproved that Biſhop (for Biſhops above Presbyters were ſo early) to whoſe cuſtody he had committed him, but himſelf in his <hi>decrepit years</hi> (true love never growing old, or cold and infirm) ſought him, found him, followed him, overtook him, overcame him, firſt with the young mans ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, then with his own paternal prayers and tears, which never ceaſed till he had recovered ſo welcome a <hi>captive</hi> to Chriſt and his Church. So loth was that holy man, and ſo was I (though vaſtly ſhort of that beloved Diſciple) that either the labour of love ſhould be loſt upon any, or that any we love ſhould be loſt for want of any labour for their good; no defenſative being too much to preſerve a ſoul from the ſnares of ſin, and the hazzards of damnation.</p>
            <p>After he was returned into <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflict my ſelf to tell you, how (amidſt all the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114785:56"/>receptions, viſits, and careſſes which he received or payed to his many noble and neer relations) he forgot not (by any juvenile or ſupercilious negligence) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to me and mine ſuch civility, kindneſs, and noble gratitude, as ſhewed both living and dying that he had a real value, love, and confidence of me. I confeſs I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly deplore my loſs of him, not that I either hoped or expected any ſecular advantages by his private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſtation beyond thoſe civil courteſies which I have oft enjoyed from his other noble relations, which if I did never deſerve, yet I hope I did never abuſe. As for publique favours, attainable by any mans mediation, I underſtand my ſelf and the times ſo well in the point of preferment as not to look toward any, which are now rare to he ſeen in <hi>England</hi> for any <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> of my proportions: nor am I ſo vain as to ſeek in vain thoſe little <hi>great things</hi> for my ſelf further then an <hi>Evangelical</hi> and unenviable plow in a poor Country village; where (as in moſt populous and plebeian <hi>Auditories)</hi> much good ſeed is loſt, much ſtudy and pains fruſtrated, by falling on the <hi>thority, ſtony,</hi> and <hi>high-way grounds.</hi> But my work and wages, I hope, are with Him who is a merciful Maſter, and moſt impartially bountiful Patron to all faithful Labourers in his husbandry, among which I beſeech God I may be found one, in whom ability, induſtry, and fidelity may help to keep up the authority of Evangelical Miniſtry from being trodden under the feet of plebeian petulancy, and mechanicke inſolency, under which <hi>Incubuſſes</hi> in many places it is miſerably faln. No, my grief is partly that I have not ſo improved the <hi>opportunities</hi> of his life and my <hi>intereſt</hi> with him, as poſſibly I might and ſhould had I been <hi>aware</hi> (though I confeſs for <hi>ſome months</hi> paſt I was jealous) he would ere long deprive me and all the world of <hi>all capacities</hi> to ſerve him; which is the other part of my ſorrow: this fear made me add of late ſuch frequencies to my <hi>viſits</hi> as I thought not unacce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable, ſtill aiming to catch thoſe <hi>(molliſſima tempora fandi)</hi> ſeaſonable advantages in reſpect of his urgent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114785:56"/>as might do him moſt good, in being his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer</hi> for the <hi>main matters</hi> of life and death, that <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> his <hi>eternal</hi> intereſts, in compariſon of which all things of <hi>Houſes, Lands, Honours, Wife, Children,</hi> Crowns and Kingdoms, are <hi>as loſſe and dung.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſeemed not to expect <hi>a long life</hi> ſince he could judge what it was to live; by I know not what <hi>ſecret preſage,</hi> he would <hi>oft ſay</hi> in the height and vigor <hi>of his youth, He ſhould not live beyond his Mothers age,</hi> who died under 27. and he under 24. God you ſee hath verified what was <hi>foretold,</hi> I believe more beyond all their expectations that knew him then <hi>his own,</hi> who certainly had ſome <hi>ſecret monition,</hi> which (I hope) he did not wholly neglect, though (poſſibly) he did not ſo much regard it as the event would have required, having the hopes and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>confidences</hi> of youth and ſpirit yet attending him.</p>
            <p>This poſſibly encouraged him (as is uſual) the more earneſtly to purſue thoſe allowed <hi>contentments of life,</hi> which he conceived might <hi>moſt contribute</hi> to his <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> then it may be he would have done if he had <hi>foreſeen</hi> the ſpeedy and impendent <hi>period of his life:</hi> and how much more <hi>neceſſary</hi> for his true intereſts, the eternal peace and happineſs <hi>of his ſoul,</hi> the gracious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of his ſhort time had been beyond the moſt deſerving conſort, and moſt ſplendid fortune in the world? the enjoyment of which God <hi>ſoon</hi> deprived him of, and (I hope) ſo far weaned his heart from them, and raiſed it above them, as became one that was ſhortly <hi>to leave them,</hi> after he had but a few months beheld them, not without much <hi>anxiety</hi> and bodily <hi>infirmity.</hi>

Then I did (according to the wiſedome that God gave me) demand many things of him, in the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, exacteſt, and ſhorteſt method which I could, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to receive from him ſuch a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of his ſins, and of his ſerious repentance, of his deep ſenſe of the want of Chriſt as a Saviour, of owning the excellent worth that is in Chriſt, of the full and free <hi>grace</hi> of God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt, of his humble <hi>deſires and hopes of it,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>preparedneſs to die,</hi> if God would have it ſo; And in general, of his firm perſwaſion that thoſe things <hi>were true</hi> which he had been taught by me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters of the <hi>Church of England</hi> out of Gods word. To all the whole ſeries of my queſtions &amp; diſcourſe he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally anſwered with ſuch <hi>prayers</hi> &amp; <hi>tears,</hi> ſuch <hi>deep ſighs,</hi> ſuch <hi>fervent Amens,</hi> and ſuch <hi>pathetick expreſſions,</hi> as I could expect in his <hi>weak condition.</hi> To my laſt query concerning <hi>his belief of the Truths of God in his Word,</hi> he replyed with a <hi>vehemency</hi> of voice and ſpirit, <q>
                  <hi>Do I believe them?</hi> yes (Sr.) <hi>I thank God I do believe them, as moſt gracious and glorious truths, and I hope my heavenly Father will make them good to my ſoul.</hi>
               </q> This laſt expreſſion (my heavenly Father) he oft uſed as alone ſo to me and others; A

            </p>
            <p>After this my <hi>private diſcourſe</hi> with him about a quarter of an hour, his noble friends joyned with me in <hi>prayer to God</hi> for him, to which he was compoſedly intent and fervent. In the <hi>afternoon,</hi> ſoon after he had againe ſpoken in his dying <hi>agonies</hi> ſome <hi>like paſſionate, pious,</hi> and <hi>humble words to me,</hi> as beſt <hi>befits the mouth of a dying Chriſtian,</hi> he <hi>calmly</hi> and <hi>ſuddenly expired</hi> without any great conteſt with <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far be it from me (who never <hi>flattered</hi> him or any man <hi>living</hi> except my ſelf) to commend him (<hi>now dead</hi> and <hi>gone)</hi> after thoſe riotous <hi>Hyperboles</hi> and envied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes which the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Orators</hi> uſed at the Funeral <hi>piles</hi> (or <hi>buſta</hi>) of their <hi>deceaſed friends.</hi> Nor will I ſcatter upon his <hi>herſe</hi> thoſe <hi>flowers</hi> which ancient Fathers and other <hi>Chriſtian Orators</hi> uſed gravely and more deſervedly in their <hi>Funeral Sermons, Orations,</hi> and <hi>Epitaphs,</hi> applied to many holy men and women of old, who died either young, as <hi>Nepotian</hi> (whom St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſo highly commends) or elder, as Martyrs, Confeſſors, and eminent profeſſors of Chriſt crucified: it was but pious and prudent that their light both living and dead ſhould ſo ſhine before men,

The <hi>account</hi> of their <hi>diſcovery</hi> amounts to no more then this, <hi>That he died of that ſcrophulous humor abounding in him,</hi> which we call the <hi>Struma,</hi> or <hi>Kings evil,</hi> full of little and great <hi>knots</hi> or <hi>kernels</hi> in <hi>his lungs</hi> and <hi>entrails,</hi> ſome as big as <hi>pullets eggs,</hi> ſome larger, and adherent to the <hi>backbone</hi> on both ſides; his lungs ſo full of that <hi>caſeous or cheeſe-like</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that they were <hi>ſwelled</hi> and <hi>inflamed</hi> to a <hi>quantity</hi> too big <hi>for his breſt and breathing,</hi> ſo that he died on the <hi>ſuddain,</hi> preſently after he had ſpoken and removed <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> with much ſeeming ſtrength and earneſtneſs; the heart being ſuddenly ſuffocated and waſted on one ſide or (Auricle) for want of due <hi>refreſhing:</hi> and however the <hi>lungs</hi> began in <hi>ſome folds</hi> to be <hi>putrified,</hi> yet neither my ſelf nor any other perceived either while he lived (though I ſpake very neer him) any thing offenſive in his <hi>breath,</hi> or unſavoury from his pectorals or vitals.</p>
            <p>This was the diſeaſe and <hi>languor</hi> of which this poor Gentleman died: and I know by moſt aſſured experience <hi>it hath befaln</hi> ſuch as have been both for unſpotted virtue and <hi>exquiſite handſomeneſs</hi> inferiour to no perſons living in their times.

            <p>O Lord, <hi>the</hi> everlaſting God, <hi>the only giver and preſerver of all</hi> life, <hi>natural, ſpiritual, temporal, and eternal; who haſt breathed into theſe our vile bodies of duſt the breath of</hi> life, <hi>even pretious and immortal ſouls, by which we are capable to know, to love, to live with and enjoy</hi> Thee <hi>for ever as the only</hi> Supream Good; <hi>who only art an object adequate to the vaſt capacities, and ſufficient to ſatisfie thoſe infinite deſires of living happily to eternity, which thou haſt planted in us.

Sweeten the bitter thoughts of death to us by our faith and hope in the meritorious death, the victorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and glorious aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt for our ſakes; let us find by our holineſs and newneſs of life, by our being dead with Chriſt and living to him, that we are paſſed</hi> from death to life. <hi>That our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hence may be a joyful paſſage to a better life, which conſiſts in the viſion and fruition of thy ſelf, O bleſſed</hi> Creator, <hi>who muſt needs be better then all

Vicious</hi> minds and manners (like dead <hi>carkaſſes</hi>) are then beſt, when ſo buried that nothing may appear to <hi>poſterity</hi> of their noyſome and contagious fedities: But exemplary and meritorious vertues muſt never wholly die, nor be buried in oblivion, becauſe to the injury both of the dead and the living. <hi>The name of the wicked juſtly rots;</hi> but <hi>the name of the righteous ought to be had in everlaſting remembrance.</hi> It is fit they ſhould be quite forgotten, who never did any thing worthy of memory or imitation: Nor is it leſs fit to remember thoſe with eternal honour, who did all things with honour, and in reference to Eternity. Commendation is the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due to Vertue: Imitation is the higheſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; juſt commendation and imitation make the moſt noble and durable <hi>Monument</hi> for it.
